# Letâ€™s now look at a feature allowed by Python called multiple
# inheritance. As you may have guessed from the name, this is 
# when a subclass inherits from more than one superclass. One form 
# of multiple inheritance is when there are multiple levels of 
# inheritance. This means a class inherits members from its 
# superclass and its super-superclass.
