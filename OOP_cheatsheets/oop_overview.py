# -Inheritance

# Python allows classes to inherit on multiple levels. 
# Meaning a class can inherit from a base class as well
# as a derived class. Python also supports multiple 
# inheritance, where one class can inherit from any 
# number of other classes. This allows us to describe 
# complex relationships between objects with minimal 
# repeated code.

# -Polymorphism

# Polymorphism is a concept that allows functions and 
# objects to behave in different ways depending on 
# context. There is the polymorphism of functions like 
# len() or the addition operator +, which can act 
# differently depending on the provided data.

# -Abstraction

# Python supports the concept of abstraction by allowing 
# objects with methods that have the same name, to be called 
# in a general manner. Further, Python provides the Abstract 
# Base Class (ABC) for us to create a more clearly defined 
# interface.

# -Encapsulation

# Pythonâ€™s approach to encapsulation is unique compared 
# to most other object-oriented programming languages. 
# In Python, all members of an object are publicly accessible 
# but there are conventions to indicate to developers that a 
# member is intended to be protected or private.
