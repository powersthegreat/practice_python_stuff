# When a program starts to get big, classes might 
# start to share functionality or we may lose sight 
# of the purpose of a classâ€™s inheritance structure. 
# In order to alleviate issues like this, we can use 
# the concept of abstraction.

# Abstraction helps with the design of code by 
# defining necessary behaviors to be implemented 
# within a class structure. By doing so, abstraction 
# also helps avoid leaving out or overlapping class 
# functionality as class hierarchies get larger.
